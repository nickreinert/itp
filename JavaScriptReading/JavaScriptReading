###JavaScriptReading

##Chapter 1:
- I didn't know that the binary 1s and 0s were literally the difference between a on and off signal or a shiny or dull spot on a cd.
- I already knew that the mathematical signs are called operators, and that it is common to use PEMDAS when dealing with multiple operations in a singal equation

##Chapter 2:
- I didn't know there were so many words you couldn't use in a binding.
- I already knew that you can create variables and assign values to them.

##Chapter 3:
- I didn't know about pretty much anything in this chapter, the most intereseting to me were scopes.
- I knew somewhat about the concept of global and local, the super small amount of coding I did almost 5 years ago is slightly coming back haha...
