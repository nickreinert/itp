[Our Band Site] (https://nickreinert.github.io)
- We started with the source code of the example
- We then tried to change the background color to an image in the css file. We struggled with this because we were confused on the way to call up the image. We tried to use the image url from google, then tried using the file url. Neither worked, and we eventually used the image name in the website folder and and it worked. `body {background-image: url("free-nature-images.jpg"); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat;`
- We then just simply changed the band members and descpriptions.
- We changed the band image after Annie used an app to edit the photo by switching the name of the image and adding the image to the website folder.`<h1>The Group</h1>
<img src="Programming Band.JPEG" alt="The Group">`

- We then changed all of the fonts to Papyrus. `h1 {font-family: "Papyrus";`

- Members: Sarah, Nick, Annie S, Malcolm
- Annie did photoshopping
- All of the brainstorming was a group effort.
- Nick did the literal coding but everyone helped figure out what was happening.
