# Haiku Documentation
`documentation file

:)

`
`Found a Haiku I liked, copied it, entered the say command in terminal and got it to say it, then used the -o to save it as a file called haiku.aiff.
I faced a problem when I forgot how to save the say file, so I just opened the notes from last class and found how we did it in class. Another problem was the breakage of lines in the terminal messed up the speech, so I just got rid of the breaks.`
