## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Nick's Portfolio Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is a website showcasing me and what I do.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

Class Github, Chat GPT, YouTube

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Since We haven't learned about websites yet I'm not really sure, but I think it would be in HTML. I want to have sections for the different things I do: jazz, production, and sound design.

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

I don't think the work will overlap.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Definetely have 3 sections or tabs for the different catagories, links to social media, pictures, and playable audio files

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to make it look nice, though I don't really know what that means or what it entails. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'm hoping to be able to possibly add animations and make the UI neat. I also could maybe get in a studio and record some of my compositions *for* the website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

April 13 - start research on where to start, how to get a domain...

by April 20 I would like to have a good foundation, thinking of general layout and rough draft. Most of the research would be around how to make a layout, embed links...

by April 27 I would like to start implementing materials like beats, pictures, and more design

The rest of the time would probably be used to add extra things like animation and make it look nicer.
